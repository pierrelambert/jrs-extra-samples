The install script expect (real) patch files here, NOT hotfixes
The filename must be named with the absolute folder path of the patch file, and must have a .patch extension

Example to create a patch file for the web.xml file in WEB-INF :
- go to the folder
  cd /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/jasperserver-pro/WEB-INF
- create a backup of the file
  cp web.xml web.xml.orig
- make changes in the file
  vi web.xml
- create the diff/patch file
  diff -uNr web.xml{.orig,} > _var_lib_tomcat6_webapps_jasperserver-pro_WEB-INF.patch

Example to create a recursive patch for the WEB-INF folder :
- go to the folder
  cd /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/jasperserver-pro
- create a backup of the folder
  cp WEB-INF WEB-INF.orig
- make changes in the folder files
  vi WEB-INF/web.xml
  vi WEB-INF/applicationContext-semanticLayer.xml
- create the recursive diff/patch file
  diff -uNr WEB-INF{.orig,} > _var_lib_tomcat6_webapps_jasperserver-pro_WEB-INF.patch
